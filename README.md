# cPanel-SSL
A collection of PowerShell scripts to assist with cPanel SSL functions

I'll flesh this out - someday

Once I get past some testing, I'll upload my scripts that run in the
"Certify the web" windows app to deploy/install certificates to cPanel
via it's API. You will need to have the cPanel account name and APItoken.

At this ponit in time, it's likely I'll also have some stand-alone general
cPanel SSL management scripts to assist with keeping your server's SSL tidy.
